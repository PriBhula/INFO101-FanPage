				<tr><td colspan="10"><h1>History of the Band</h1>
					<p>Since 2003, the pop punk genre has been home to sell out, chart topping band All Time Low. Originating in Maryland, Baltimore, the band formed in high school, 
					covering popular punk songs from bands like Blink-182, Green Day and New Found Glory. The band's name is taken from New Found Glory's song <em>"Head On Collision"</em> They signed their first record deal in 2004, leading to the release of their first EP <em>The Three Words to Remember in Dealing with the End.</em>
					This then paved the way for the release of All Time Low's debut studio album <em>The Party Scene.</em><br/><br/>
					Before graduating from high school in 2006, the band signed onto Hopeless Records, saying they were getting serious about music, before releasing <em>Put Up or Shut Up</em>, the band's second EP.
					This EP entered the Independent Album Charts at No. 20 and the Top Heatseekers at No. 12. Late 2006 br/ought the band to their first major tour for the EP, after which writing for the second album began<br/><br/>
					All Time Low released their second album <em>So Wrong, It's Right</em> in 2007, following their first live debut in the UK, supporting Plain White T's. The album peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard 200, with the 
					single, <em>"Dear Maria, Count Me In"</em>, reaching No. 86 on the Pop 100. The album helped the band to gain popularity, allowing them to headline and support numerous tours. MTV gave the band a lot of
					support, which lead to the band's late night TV debut on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live.</em>				At the end of 2008, All Time Low 
					was named <strong>"Band Of The Year"</strong> by <em>Alternative Press.</em><br/><br/>
					All Time Low began recording their third studio album, <em>Nothing Personal</em> at the start of 2009, with the lead single <em>"Weightless"</em> being released in March, to become their first song to receive
					global radio play. <em>Billboard Magazine</em> predicted that the album looked like it could enter the top ten of the Billboard 200 in its debut week.<em>Nothing Personal</em> debuted at No. 4 on the chart and is the
					band's highest charting album to date. In November 2009, the band signed to major label Interscope Records and a month later were voted <strong>"Best Pop Punk Band"</strong> at the Top In Rock Awards.
					In May 2010, All Time Low released their first live album, <em>Straight To DVD</em>, a recording of a show in New York.<br/><br/>
					Throughout 2010 and 2011, All Time Low continued on numerous tours around Europe, Australia and USA, playing in many countries they had never visited before.
					March 2010 saw the release of <em>"Painting Flowers"</em> for the official movie soundtrack <em>Almost Alice,</em> along with the announcement that writing had begun for the band's fourth studio album. Nearly a year later,
					the album titled <em>Dirty Work</em> was released, and is currently All Time Low's highest selling album overseas to date, with a No. 13 position in Australia and Canada, and No. 20 in the UK. 2011 also saw the band winning
					their first <em>Kerrang!</em> award for <strong>"Best Live Band"</strong>.<br/><br/>
					In June 2012, the band announced they were signing back onto Hopeless Records, with a new album being released later in the year. The band released their fourth studio album <em>Don't Panic</em>, only to re-release it a year later,
					as <em>Don't Panic: It's Longer Now!</em> in September 2013. The latest version included all the songs off the original album, as well as four new songs and acoustic remixes. In 2013, All Time Low won the <em>Kerrang!</em> Award for
					<strong>"Best International Band"</strong>. 2014 also sees numerous nominations for the <em>AP Music Awards</em>, including Song of the Year and Most Dedicated Fans.</p></td></tr>
